#Design a Python application that creates two threads named Thread1 and Thread2.

#Thread1 should display numbers from 1 to 50.
#Thread2 should display numbers from 50 to 1 in reverse order.
#Ensure that Thread2 starts execution only after Thread1 has completed.
#Use appropriate thread synchronization.
